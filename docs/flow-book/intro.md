# Introduction

I heard about you want to know more about Flow language, right?
Go grab a seat and few cups of coffee, Let get started!

## What Flow is?
1. Have you ever been tired of following chaotic "standards"?

2. Have you ever been tired of figuring out how to use libraries in the project?

3. Have you ever been tired of forgotting to release resources and get shit load of memory problems?

4. Have you ever been tired of messing with different character encodings?

Flow aimed to fix it.
