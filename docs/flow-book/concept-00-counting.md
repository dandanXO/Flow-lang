[Sesame street count photo]

```
[Scene: Midnight Sesame Street]
B - Mistery voice from no where.
C - Count, The vampire who live as a programmer.

*Count was writting Flow code*

C: Oh, greetings.
C: It is I, the Count, and it's time to answer that fascinating question: 
C: What is the first number we count from in the Flow language?

C: Let's count the elements in the array and find out.

*The array: [3, 1, 4, 6, 9, 8]*

*Pointed to the first element*
C: That's one, one element.

*Pointed to the second element*
C: That's two, two elements.

*Pointed to the third element*
C: Three, three fucking elements. argh argh argh

C: What? Nothing?
C: Noting happened.
C: Where's the output?
C: Where's the error?

C: Isn't one the starting index of an array?
*Programmer told Count index should start from zero*
C: Oh.. what?
C: Oh, we're not counting correctly haha
*After corrections, The code is finally passed its compilation.*
```

Remember, as a programmer, we count from zero. We are living on the Earth, not the moon.

Memo: Count from 0.
